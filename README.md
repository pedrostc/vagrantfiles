# Vagrant Files Archive

My personal vagrantfile archive.

## Windows Files

The windows boxes used in some of my files (mainly winXXieYY) are based upon the [modern.ie](http://modern.ie) boxes distributed by Microsoft. They were modified to properly work with a vagrant enviroment. For more information on the modifications made please refer:
